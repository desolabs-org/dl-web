# What is love4src?

Love4src aims to facilitate an open discussion about all things software by promoting exchange of opinions, news, and opportunities among people building software - software makers.

We want love4src to showcase the work of developers, UI/UX designers, and all the amazing people who build the software ecosystem of BitClout. 
Love4src is also aiming to make it easier to build, contribute and help software makers to add new tools to it.

Love4src is a node based on the open source & distributed social network - BitClout.
This node is created by and for people creating new software that is tightly integrated with the BitClout blockchain. 
Love4src is a unique version of a social network - one that is also a development environment and a sandbox for its community.

We invite you to use love4src for white-hat software development. 
It is here so that each of us doesn't have to set up a new node every time we start a new project, want to test a new feature or a new design. 
Be mindful of other community members, we want this node to be the place where we can all collaborate in a respectful and impactful manner. 

## Who is a software maker?

Software makers are all the people who are actively creating ... software. 
Visionaries who work to materialize their ideas inside computers. 
Designers who bridge the communication gap between interfaces and our brains. 
Programmers who assure computers do what humans want them to do. 
Testers who make sure we are getting results we expect. 
Investors who help us reach for the stars and focus on getting the right product to the market.

And many other people who contribute to the software revolution - digitalization of the world.

## Why is this cool?

We are all creators, but building software is hard. 
Community developers are struggling to get their work visible and often lack tools to launch their creations on the internet. 
We want the designers to be able to see for themselves how their proposed changes will look like `live`; we want web developers to be able to publish features early without the need to consider all the implications of making changes to the main codebase.

# What's in it for you?

It is easy to become a part of the love4src community. It is enough if you identify yourself as a person who ... makes software. We do need to spot you, so please give some sort of a sign of life and the onboading to love4src will start (semi)automatically.

## Post moderation

Until the `pdv` bot starts working properly, the posts on the Global feed are manually added by love4src from the Following feed. This means that if your account is followed by love4src your posts might be added to the global feed on this node.

## Whitelisting

All the accounts of software makers that are followed by `love4src` are whitelisted on this node. Sadly that doesn't seem to mean much.... yet?

## Verification

All the accounts that have demonstrated profficiency in making software, and have shown a <i>sign of good will</i> - bought $love4src or did anything else that is undeniably supportive to this node - get a verification badge.

## Cutting edge software

Due to the nature of love4src, its focus on the software community, we want it to be the node that leads all the other nodes into new features, being a so-called <i>cutting edge</i> of a node. 
Notice the difference between the <i>stable, cutting-edge and the bleeding-edge</i>. Love4src is expected to be ahead of the stable, but behind the versions that could cause harm to users. This means that we go forward with code bravely, but making sure we build rather then destroy.

# Development environment

The technology core of love4src is essentially a community development pipeline and a runtime environment that receives docker images built for main branches. 

## Trackers

Trackers are poeple who take care of love4src and facilitate its operations. 
Tomorrow we will announce the first Tracker.
